S1 Introduction-----------------------------------
Core	objectives	and	principles	that	cloud	
computing	must	meet	to	be	successful:		
  1. Security	
  2. Scalability
  3. Availability	
  4. Performance	
  5. Cost-effective	
  6. Acquire	resources	on	demand	
  7. Release	resources	when	no	longer	needed	
  8. Pay	for	what	you	use	
  9. Leverage	others’	core	competencies	
  10. Turn	fixed	cost	into	variable	cost

S1 Cost-efficiency---------------------------------
1. Utility Calculation:
  charged cost per unit = cost per unit/utilization
  #utilization = used percentage

2. Trends: 
  2.1 Personal cloud -> Public cloud                  30%->60%
  2.2 On	Demand	Pricing	to	Increase	Utilization   60%->80%
  2.3 Spot	Prices	to	Drive	Additional	Demand      80%->90%

S3 On demand & Comparative advantage----------------
capacity = peak use
cost per unit used = cost per unit *(idle+used)/used

On demand - IT capacity Mgmt
Allocated IT capacities > Actual load

Optimization for different demand type
cost-efficient analysis examples: facebook, newyork time, dropbox

On-premise infra -> cloud-based infra
more time to focus on business

What	Happens	in	Competitive	Markets?
• Firms	make	short	term	abnormal	profit	
• Other	firms	enter	the	industry	to	take	advantage	of	
abnormal	profit
• Supply	increases	and	prices	fall
• Over	the	long	run,	normal	profit	is	made
• Consumers	have	choice
• Prices	remain	sufficient	to	make	normal	profit	but	no	
more

Advantages	of	Perfect	Competition
• High	degree	of	competition	helps	allocate	resources	
to	most	efficient	use	
• Price	=	marginal	costs	
• Normal	profit	made	in	the	long	run	
• Firms	operate	at	maximum	efficiency	
• Consumers	benefit
