Core	objectives	and	principles	that	cloud	
computing	must	meet	to	be	successful:		
  1. Security	
  2. Scalability
  3. Availability	
  4. Performance	
  5. Cost-effective	
  6. Acquire	resources	on	demand	
  7. Release	resources	when	no	longer	needed	
  8. Pay	for	what	you	use	
  9. Leverage	othersâ€™	core	competencies	
  10. Turn	fixed	cost	into	variable	cost

S1 Cost-efficiency---------------------------------
1. Utility Calculation:
  charged cost per unit = cost per unit/utilization
  #utilization = used percentage

2. Trends: 
  2.1 Personal cloud -> Public cloud                  30%->60%
  2.2 On	Demand	Pricing	to	Increase	Utilization   60%->80%
  2.3 Spot	Prices	to	Drive	Additional	Demand      80%->90%
