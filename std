Process Improvements
Standard
Process standardization,
Over time, large organizations have accumulated multiple, disparate and often redundant processes that have been established to accomplish the same purpose throughout the organization. This development generally leads to sub-optimal effectiveness and efficiency and a lack of ability to deliver products and services in a consistent fashion.

1.	What
-	Following process improvement, process standardization is a set of uniform specification, criteria, methods, or practices that increase production and efficiency.
-	Not process improvement, more like implementation
-	Lower hierarchy than process improvement (procedure -> best practice)
-	Showing the hierarchy graph
2.	Problem
-	Different forms of output
-	Redundant work and rework
-	Accuracy
-	Inefficiency caused by inconsistent process
3.	Why
-	Reduce the inefficiency caused by consolidating different forms of output
-	Build a guideline/best practice to reduce redundant work and unnecessary rework
-	Provide necessary training to improve accountability and accuracy
-	A consistent implementation of procedure
4.	How
-	Training
-	Guidelines/Best practice documentation
-	Accenture best practice(future developments)
o	Process Standardization Approach
o	Preparation
	Review and Analyze
	Conduct Pilot Session
o	Facilitation: acknowledge – analysis, consensus, variation reduction, minimization of non-value added activity
o	Documentation: metrics and plan, timeline
o	Standardization
o	Monitor
	Monitor process implementation
	Verify process performance and adherence
	Validate alignment to compliance requirements, goals and objectives
	Escalate, govern and change
	Ensure sustainability
